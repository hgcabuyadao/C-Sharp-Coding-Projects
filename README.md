# C-Sharp-Coding-Projects
These are small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework


Projects:

- Car Insurance
- Server Date Time


Car Insurance
  This Project is  an MVC web apllciation that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information
and calculates a quote base on business logic. THere is also and admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes 
that have been issued.


Server Date Time
  This project is a simple ASP.NET Core web app that displays the actual server time in the browser.
